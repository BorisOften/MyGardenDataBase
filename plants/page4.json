                  "planting_tip": "For successful cultivation of Detroit Dark Red Beet, directly sow seeds in well-draining soil with moderate fertility. Plant in a sunny to partially shaded location for optimal growth. Keep the soil consistently moist to encourage tender root development. Harvest beets when they reach the desired size, typically around 2-3 inches in diameter. Beet greens can also be harvested for culinary use."
